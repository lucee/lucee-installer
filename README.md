# Lucee Installer #

BitRock Installer XML config and files for creating the Lucee installers for Windows and Linux.

Bitrock has provided LAS with an Enterprise license for InstallBuilder, it's not in source source control

Forked from the great work by Vivotech, <https://github.com/viviotech/lucee-installer>, LAS is now managing the Lucee Installer Releases.

Note: You must build the Linux Installer on Linux, otherwise the file permissions like execute are missing.

## Github Actions ##

We now have an automated GitHub action to build, test and publish the Windows and Linux installers

## Automated build script ##
`JRE_URL=https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.23%2B9/OpenJDK11U-jre_x64_linux_hotspot_11.0.23_9.tar.gz TOMCAT_URL=https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.89/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.91.tar.gz LUCEE_VERSION=6.0.3.1 ./build.sh`

## Manual Build ##
### Preparation ###

None of the main binaries are checked into source control, the following manual steps are required:

The Lucee loader jar goes into the `lucee/lucee/lib` folder, i.e. <https://cdn.lucee.org/lucee-6.0.1.83.jar>

Download and extract the Tomcat 9 distribution into the `lucee/tomcat9/tomcat` folder, make sure you use the `tar.gz` version for Linux or the `.zip` version for Windows

Delete the `lucee/tomcat9/tomcat/webapps/` folder (Lucee has it's own)

Copy the customised `lucee/tomcat9/tomcat-lucee-conf` Lucee Tomcat configuration files over the extracted Tomcat distribution files  in `lucee/tomcat9/tomcat`.

Download the Windows or Linux 64-bit JREs from <https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html> and extract them into the appropriate `/jre` folders (delete the manual directory from the linux JRE)

Download and install the InstallBuilder Enterprise Edition <https://installbuilder.com/> make sure it's x64 version

Update the Version Number under Product Details in InstallBuilder

### Building the Installer ###

Simply open the [lucee/lucee.xml](lucee/lucee.xml) file in InstallBuilder and click the Build icon.
